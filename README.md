This dictionary is a revised version of the Strongs Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible. These revisions include:

 - English definitions have been revised for modern English langauge conventions. Older English words have been replaced with modern equivalents. A conservative effort to has been made to clarify English gender where appropriate. i.e. ἄνθρωπος is updated to include the glosses "man, person, mankind, human" 
 - Defintions have been split or merged based upon modern lingustic understanding of Koine Greek.
 - The dictionary has been slightly expanded to include some vocabulary that appears outside of the New Testament to support other Koine Era Greek text. This includes support for Athanaze.
